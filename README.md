# Research-Project
This is code for the language R that I have written for my Research Project that involves the analysis of Brassica oleracea transcriptome data to identify genes of intrest that may be linked to improving reisstance against heat shock and drought stress.
There are three files each with code that will carry out a different procedure. They all follow the same template but contain different variables that will compare different conditions. Ensure that when running the code that you start from the beginning so that the varibles are reset as there is cross over in the names of the files. 
The file consolidatetext.csv and cat_drought_meta_data.csv is needed.
